        <h1>Graffiti</h1>

        <p>
            Graffiti lets you integrate custom social features into any static
            website with just a few lines of HTML and JavaScript. These features
            can be as relatively simple, as in the demo below, or amount to
            full-fledged applications similar to
            <a href="https://glitter.graffiti.garden">Twitter</a>,
            <a href="https://parallax.graffiti.garden">Messenger</a>, and
            <a href="https://wiki.graffiti.garden">Wikipedia</a>
            with plenty of room for
            <a href="https://gluefactory.live">new designs</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Applications within the Graffiti ecosystem also interoperate. If
            your friends use a Graffiti application that you don't like, you can
            either modify it, create your own from scratch, or switch to an
            application that someone else has already built â€” all without losing
            your friends! You can change pretty much anything including the
            moderation system, privacy settings, feed sorting algorithm, site
            layout, color scheme, and so on.
