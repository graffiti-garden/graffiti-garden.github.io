\section{Above and Below}
\label{above-and-below}

We now describe the tooling we've built \emph{above}
the Graffiti API that makes development even easier, and
the implementations we've built \emph{below} the API
that realize different trade-offs between efficiency and
robustness.

While we have made insights on both fronts that at
the least demonstrate \emph{feasibility},
there are, of course,
many unanswered questions and unexplored ideas.
Fortunately, by having a fixed API in the middle, work done above the API
is \emph{decoupled} from work done below.
It is possible to drop in a new, more efficient, or privacy-preserving implementation
without upheaving all the tools and applications that have been built on top.
% Additionally, as mentioned, it is possible for different implementations to coexist,
% allowing for a smooth transition to a strictly better solution, akin the move from \texttt{http} to \texttt{https},
% or the perpetual coexistence of solutions, each with their own strengths.
% allowing for a smooth transition o
% It is also possible below for different implementations to coexist,
% much like how on top it is possible for different development frameworks
% to coexist.
% Implementations that are more efficient, secure can be developed independently
% of the high level tools and moreover switching will be easy.

% both above and below there is future work to be done.
% Low and now code tools and graphical editors.
% Efficient protocols.
% However by building this API in the middle
% we have \emph{decoupled} these two endeavors and they can
% proceed in parallel without being dependent or interfering on each other.

\subsection{Above}

While the API has hidden a lot of complexity below,
like the need to write and deploy server code or the need to
consider the server infrastructure at all,
writing frontend code is still inaccessible
to many people.
We have made some initial steps towards reducing the
programming complexity by allowing for the \emph{reactive} and
\emph{declarative} programming of Graffiti applications
and by providing a growing library of resusable design patterns.
We also point to a future where Graffiti applications could be built
without any code at all.

% \subsubsection{Internal Synchronization}

% When a user likes a post or sends a message,
% it is necessary, for the usability of the interface, for the user
% to get instant feedback that their action completed
% successfully, by seeing a like counter increment or seeing their message
% appear in the chat.
% While it is possible to manually update the relevant sections of the UI,
% this is unnecessary work for the developer and
% can become unwieldy with many interconnected components.

% Instead, we built a library for internal synchronization\footnote{
%   \url{https://sync.graffiti.garden/classes/GraffitiSynchronize.html}
% } that wraps around the Graffiti API to make these updates automatic.
% Whenever the library encounters a new or changed object, either because
% the user created, modified, or deleted an object,
% or because an object was received from \texttt{get}
% or \texttt{discover}, that change is internally forwarded to an
% appropriate listener.
% These listeners can be set up manually with the new methods \texttt{synchronizeDiscover}
% and \texttt{synchronizeGet} or automatically by our Vue Plugin, described next.

% a user makes or receives a change, that change is internally forwarded
% to an appropriate listener.
% This library frosm the building block of reactivity that we build on
% in Section

% , set up with a new method \texttt{synchronizeDiscover}.



% This makes changes instant, without having to go over the network
% and require little additonal work

% Suppose one of a user's friends changes their name. As soon as the user's
% application receives one notice of that change (using get or discover),
% then synchronizeDiscover listeners can be used to update all instance's of
% that friend's name in the user's application instantly, providing a consistent user experience.

\subsubsection{Vue Plugin}

Vue is a popular front-end framework that enables ``reactive'' programming where
changes to the underlying state are automatically reflected in the UI.
We built a plugin for Vue\footnote{
  \url{https://vue.graffiti.garden/variables/GraffitiPlugin.html}
}
that provides a variant of
\texttt{discover} which returns a reactive array of objects rather than
an asynchronous stream.
Any CRUD operation that the user triggers locally instantly updates
the relevant array, while remote changes can be polled manually
with \texttt{poll()} or automatically
with an \texttt{autopoll} setting.
% The plugin similarly provides reactive variants of \texttt{get} and
% \texttt{recoverOrphans}.

% the array automatically while the \texttt{poll}
% function can be called to fetch remote changes.
% Vue lets all of these changes propogate automatically to UI components.

% operation to be returned reactively.
% The plugin combines the traditional

% We built a plugin for the Vue frontend framework that
% builds upon the internal syncrhonization library.
% The plugin combines \texttt{discover} with \texttt{syncrhonizeDiscover}
% and keeps a reactive array of all the results returned by a discover stream
% in
% Local changes update live, while remote changes can be polled by calling
% \texttt{poll}.
% It is still possible for a user to manually manage other \texttt{session}s
% for multi-actor applications.

% The plugin exposes this reactive functionality with both
% ``composable'' functions,
% % \footnote{
% %   \url{https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables.html}
% % }
% like \texttt{useGraffitiDiscover}, which can be used
% in a more traditional programming environment, as well as
% ``renderless components,''
% \footnote{
%   \url{https://vuejs.org/guide/components/slots#renderless-components}
% }
% like \texttt{<GraffitiDiscover>},
% which can be used declaratively within an HTML template.
% Additionally, for convenience,
% the plugin sets up a global Graffiti class instance, \texttt{\$graffiti},
% as well as a global
% \texttt{\$graffitiSession}.
This reactivity is available in a traditional programming
environment as well as in a declarative HTML-like template.
The plugin maintains complete TypeScript support and
is a relatively light wrapper over a Graffiti-specific reactivity library we have developed\footnote{
   \url{https://sync.graffiti.garden/classes/GraffitiSynchronize.html}
}
and so support for other front-end frameworks, like React, will be
fairly easy to add in the future.

Below is the complete template for a micro social application,
built with the plugin, that shows a (continuously updating) list of all messages posted to a realtime group chat and enables the user to post their own message:
\begin{minted}{vue}
<form v-if="$graffitiSession.value"
  @submit.prevent="$graffiti.put({
    value: { content },
    channels: [ 'my-group' ]
  }, $graffitiSession.value)"
>
  <input v-model="content" />
  <input type="submit" value="Post" />
</form>
<button v-else @click="$graffiti.login()">
  Log In to Post!
</button>
<GraffitiDiscover autopoll
  v-slot="{ objects: messages }"
  :channels="[ 'my-group' ]"
  :schema="{
    properties: {
      value: {
        required: ['content'],
        properties: {
          content: { type: 'string' },
        }
      }
    }
  }"
>
  <ul>
    <li v-for="message in messages">
      {{ message.value.content }}
    </li>
  </ul>
</GraffitiDiscover>
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Pattern Library}

We have started compiling a library of common patterns\footnote{
    \url{https://vue.graffiti.garden/examples/}
} that currently includes likes, profiles, threaded comments,
and different messaging patterns.
These patterns build on top of the Vue plugin
and are self-contained in \emph{single HTML files}
which can be downloaded, modified, and copied into other
applications.
Perhaps this format can encourage the copy and paste ``pimp my page''
programming that was once possible on MySpace, but with the ability
add new \emph{functionality} rather than just styling~\cite{copypasteliteracy}.

\subsubsection{Future Work}
\label{above-and-below:above:future-work}

There is certainly potential for more low or even no-code tools
to be developed on top of the Graffiti API. It is an open
question as to whether it is possible to build an intuitive and completely
no-code system for Graffiti, like a graphical editor, without limiting
its extensibility.

Additionally, in our own application development,
we found that inline AI tools like GitHub Copilot are already
capable of generating large portions of functional Graffiti code.
This is especially true when writing applications with the
Vue plugin, perhaps because of the reduction in boilerplate
code and the declarative nature of the templates.
It is not hard to imagine a future where a developer asks
a large language model to ``make a messaging app''
or to ``add a bookmark button to posts in this application'' and
it simply works.
% CITE

%DK this paragraph is somewhat hard to understand and could safely be sacrified for space I think
Finally, users may gravitate towards using ``meta'' applications.
Users of these applications could easily change their functionality
by swapping out different plugins,
which could represent different feed sorting algorithms
(similar to \cite{threeleggedstool, bluesky}),
different moderation policies, different styles,
or different features.
A code-as-data approach would allow these plugins to be shared
as Graffiti objects themselves~\cite{webstrates}.
% Or portions of applications may become represented within social objects themselves.
% MySpace, for example, let users style their own pages --- what if users could easily add
% custom social functionality to their own
% or their community's ``pages''?

\subsection{Below}

The Graffiti API is relatively simple
and so its implementation must solve just two main problems:
storing objects and discovering objects by channel.
One solution is to store all objects on a massive database
and then discovery is trivially a query on that database.
Unfortunately, this centralizes all control of the network
on that single server.
%DK I wouldn't discard this so quickly, especially since this is basically what you get if you implement the remote: protocol but only have one server (which I suspect is the situatinon we are currently in).   So instead of appearing to discard this, I would talk about *extending* it to allow multiple servers so there is no single point of control.

Instead, we explore \emph{decentralized protocols} for the API.
In one protocol, objects are served by a ``federation'' of databases,
each of which is like a small version of the centralized database.
In another, the problems of storage and discovery are split up,
with existing providers similar to Dropbox handling storage
and a new entity called a ``tracker'' handling discovery.

The former protocol is more efficient while the latter is more robust.
%DK I am not sure what "robust" means in this context and would prefer a more direct explanation of the tradeoffs.  Also by some measures it is the second protocol that is more efficient since it outsources the storage work.
% There are tradeoffs between these in terms of efficiency, scalability,
Fortunately, multiple \emph{protocols} can be understood within one \emph{implementation},
allowing new protocols
with different tradeoffs to be organically adopted without requiring
everyone to collectively switch all at once.
This is possible because, as we have mentioned, an object's URL starts with a scheme that indicates
how the various CRUD methods should resolve and interact with the object.
If a user tries to \texttt{delete} an object whose URL starts with the schema
\texttt{graffiti:remote:}, their implementation will use the \emph{remote}
protocol, while if the URL starts with the schema \texttt{graffiti:csp:},
their implementation will use the \emph{commodity storage} protocol.
For \texttt{discover}, multiple protocol-specific \texttt{discover}
calls can simply be aggregated together into one stream.
%DK I don't understand what this last means, since a discover call does not specify a protoco.   so what is a protocol-specific discover call?   In fact, this paragraph is retrospecively a bit confusing because it talks about URLs (getting single objects) but doesn't talk about channels (central too discover)

There are two additional questions we need to resolve to
make coexisting protocols work.
Which protocol should an implementation use
when an actor \emph{first} \texttt{put}s an object?
And what \emph{identity} system will work across multiple
protocols?

For the question of first \texttt{put}s, we simply give the user the choice.
The first time a user attempts to \texttt{put} an object,
a popup opens,
as shown in Figure~\ref{above-and-below:figure:choose-protocol},
asking them which protocol they would like to use
as well as protocol-specific information, such as what server
they want to store their data on.
We have tried to make the experience relatively frictionless, with
reasonable defaults for
users who do not know or care about the underlying infrastructure.
Importantly, this interface is built into the \emph{implementation}
of the API and so it is not the concern of developers building
applications on top of the API.
% As mentioned in Section~\ref{above-and-below:delegation},
% a user can later migrate their data to a different protocol
% or server without breaking their object's URLs.

% Some choice is give to users - which they can ignore - but none of
% this needs to be build by developed implementing on top of the API,
% it all exists in the implementation \emph{below} the API.k
\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{paper/figures/choose-protocol.png}
    \caption{The modal that pops up when the user triggers a \texttt{put()} for the first time.}
    \label{above-and-below:figure:choose-protocol}
\end{figure}

As for identity, we currently use a decentralized protocol called Solid OIDC~\cite{solidoidc}.
It has the useful property that a user only needs to log in once
with an ``identity provider'' before silently authenticating
them with other services.
It is also already used by the Solid protocol~\cite{solid},
which we use in our commodity storage protocol as a ``decentralized Dropbox.''

Unfortunately, Solid OIDC is incompatible with many familiar
identity solutions, like ``Log in with Google,''
and many novel identity solutions, like ``Sign in with Ethereum.''
The Decentralized Identifier (DID) specification attempts to unify
these various identity methods, but currently DIDs require that
users log in with \emph{each} service they want to authenticate with~\cite{dids}.
This is like requiring a user to log in again every time
they receive an email from a new email server, which would
be tedious and confusing.
We hope that DIDs or new specifications evolve past this restriction.

% Importantly, our protocols
% are directly \emph{client-to-server}, since
% the API is designed to be used by client-side applications
% to make development ``serverless'' per requirement~\ref{requirements:serverless}.

After discussing our two main protocols, we discuss
a bonus ``utility'' protocol that demonstrates
additional power of our separation
between the API and the protocol.
% We also discuss how
% how objects are verified to come from a particular
% actor without repudiation per
% requirement~\ref{requirements:forgiving}.


% more than one implementation can
% exist.



% The API we've described is fairly simple, and can be done
% with existing technologies.
% The main things are:
% - storing objects,
% - retrieving objects,
% - authenticating
% - and verifying.

% As mentioned, different protocols can do these different
% things. The web gives us a way to do storing.

% While we have not implemented why not create another protocol
% called \texttt{graffiti-google}.
% Users store objects in spreadsheets.
% Obviously there are limitations regarding who can control.
% But it is nice.

% Now we come to the problem of actually \emph{implementing} the Graffiti API.
% As mentioned, an implementation can consist of multiple coexisting communication
% \emph{protocols}.
% We outline several communication protocols and their implementations first,
% and then how they can be used in tandem.
% in a single implementation.

% We focus on scalability and trust.

% Finally, when there are multiple competing protocols,
% some user interface must be provided to the end user to choose which protocol
% they would like to use to \texttt{put} their own data
% as shown in Figure.
% some small amount of input on which protocol they would
% use to host their own data, however this decision can be remembered.
% can be remembered after they first call \texttt{put}.
% to
% \texttt{discover} can aggregate the results of \texttt{discover} from multiple protocols.
% Finally, there is the small problem of decided which protocol to use
% when an actor first \texttt{put}s an object.
% A URL includes within it a scheme that specifies which protocol to use.
% When calling \texttt{discover}, it can pull results from multiple
% different implementations and aggregate the results.

% j
% related to the Solid project,
% however it.
% A user logs in once to an \emph{identity provider} which then allows them
% to log in to various services.

% However a Solid OIDC only allows for webIds not other sorts of identity.
% It also has usability challenges - a user is asked to type in a URL.
% Chapi is attempting to fix this.
% We recommend to authors in this space to try to fuse the benefits
% of these protocols.

% but currently has shortcomings listed in Section~\ref{protocols}.

% The goal of systems \emph{below} the API is to make sure the
% API is implemented efficiently, scalably, and to provide \emph{trust}.
% For example, we could implement


% Since Graffiti implementations can coexist by using different URL schemes,
% it is possible to use the local implementation in tandem with other implementations.
% This lets a user try out Graffiti applications without having to create an
% account. The data they use in the trial will simply only be visible locally but
% not available to others. At this time the data cannot be transferred once
% a user decides to create an account, but this is scheduled to be added in the future.

% Our local implementation builds on PouchDB which provides persistent
% storage both in the browser and in node.js.
% and pieces of its implementation are used in all of the other implementations.

% The local implementation is an implementation of Graffiti where all data is stored
% locally and only availble on one device. While this seems strange for a tool
% proported to build social applications, it is paramount to the developement experience.
% It allows for rapid iteration and testing, and creation of users.

% When a user calls "login()" in the local implementation, a popup appears that
% simply asks them to type in their actor ID, no additional authentication is required.
% They don't need to worry about polluting their own online presence with test data.
% Once an application it can be swapped out seamlessly with any of the other applications
% by just changing one line of code.

% Our local implementation builds on PouchDB which provides persistent
% storage both in the browser and in node.js.

% A local implementation is possible to be used

% Additionally, it also makes it possible to have hybrid implementations,
% that draw from multiple sources.

\subsubsection{Remote Protocol}
\label{above-and-below:remote-protocol}

The remote protocol involves a federation of servers,
each of which exposes the Graffiti API through an HTTP API.
Like email, users can choose which server they would
like to use or run their own.
Unlike email, the servers do not send objects to each other.
Instead, the client fetches objects directly from servers,
differentiating servers by \emph{domain} much like
protocols are differentiated by \emph{scheme}.

For discovery, we currently provide a registry of servers
and clients call \texttt{discover} on all servers in the registry.
If many servers are deployed, discovering from every one
will be infeasible and so instead we can use an ``announce''
protocol, detailed in the Appendix, that builds on top of the remote protocol and
that allows the client to only call discover on the servers
of interest
%DK what does "of interest" mean?  I'd like to contact only servers that have content in a target channel, but servers cannot announce what channels they have without publicizing channel names
plus a small constant number of well-known
``\emph{rendez-vous}'' servers.

% However, unlike email federation happens at the
% \emph{client}. Individual servers do not pass messages to
% each other, the client implementation just polls multiple servers, similar
% to the way that it can pull data from multiple protocols.
Our reference implementation of the remote protocol
consists of a NestJS server with a CouchDB database,
bundled as a Docker image for easy cross-platform
deployment\footnote{
See supplementary materials.
% \url{https://github.com/graffiti-garden/implementation-remote}
}.

% The remote protocol exposes the Graffiti API as a.
% We've implemented it as a node.js server and a Docker
% Users can stand up their own server like an email or Mastodon
% server enabling more control.

% Unlike those other services, which pass messages between
% server, federation happens at the client, ensuring that
% a user's experience can be flexibly changed by what
% application they are using not what storage service they happen to use.

% We currently provide a \emph{registry} of servers which
% users can use to find other servers to communicate with.
% This is a central point of control and has efficiecy issues which we discuss later.
% Currently we only offer one server so this is not an issue,
% but we provide an alternative ``anouncement protocol''
% built on the system themselves in the appendix.
% The simplest way for a client to know which
% servers to query is for there to
% be a public ``registry'' of servers.
% This is the method used by BlueSky~\cite{bluesky}
% % and by other federated services like
% % the \texttt{apt} package manager
% % certificate authorities
% % and package managers
% and is available in our
% own implementation.
% A registry is simple, but it is a potential central point of control
% and it does not allow for new
% servers to easily enter the network.
% Additionally, if there are too many servers, a registry can become
% incredibly inefficient as each \texttt{discover} operation needs to be called
% on \emph{every} registered server, when it is likely that relavent data
% will only exist on a sparse subset of servers.

% We provide a more decentralized and efficient
% solution that works \emph{on top} of the remote protocol,
% however it is involved enough that we consider it its own sub-protocol.
% We discuss it in Section~\ref{above-and-below:announce-protocol} after introducing the concept
% of a \emph{tracker}
% in Section~\ref{above-and-below:commodity-storage-protocol}.

% The remote protocol maps the Graffiti API onto
% a monolithic HTTP server.
% The protocol is a relatively straightforward transformation of
% Graffiti's API methods to HTTP requests: the CRUD operations
% easily translate to HTTP PUT, GET, PATCH, and DELETE while
% the other operations are additional POST endpoints.
% \texttt{discover}, \texttt{recoverOrphans}, and \texttt{channelStats}
% are additional POST endpoints.
% Object URLs start with the scheme \texttt{graffiti:remote:}
% followed by the domain name of the server and the
% path to the object. The result is similar to a traditional
% web URL only with \texttt{https://} replaced by \texttt{graffiti:remote:}.
% For example, \texttt{graffiti:remote:pod.graffiti.garden/123}.

% When there is only one server in use, the protocol is essentially
% \emph{centralized} which is extremely efficient and scalable but requires
% enourmous trust in the central server.
% With multiple servers deployed,
% a user can choose which they would like to use to store their own data
% (see Figure~\ref{above-and-below:choose-protocol})
% and their client can call \texttt{discover} on
% multiple servers and aggregate the results,
% allowing the user to communicate with others regardless
% of their choice of server.

% This network topology is an example of \emph{federation},
% a form of decentralization, which is used by most of the
% existing social protocols that we survey in Section~\ref{related-work},
% as well as familiar services like email.
% Federation provides defense against a centralized entity
% co-opting the network.
% However, our use of it here begs the questions:
% How does a client know which servers to federate with?
% How can an actor authenticate with multiple servers?
% We answer these questions and others below.

% There are several questions:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item How does a client application know which servers to query?
%     \item How can actor authenticate with multiple servers to receive
%     private objects?
%     \item How can a client application verify that an object
%     was created by a particular actor?
% \end{enumerate}

% \paragraph{Server Discovery}


% \paragraph{Authentication}
% Actors in the remote protocol are authenticated with an existing
% identity protocol called Solid OIDC.
% Solid OIDC allows an actor to log in \emph{once} to an
% ``identity provider'' (see Figure~\ref{above-and-below:login})
% and then silently authenticate with multiple
% other servers.
% The user's actor URI is a URL called a \emph{webId}.
% We discuss Solid OIDC and identity in general in our discussion of
% coexisting protocols, Section~\ref{above-and-below:coexisting-protocols}.
% with different
% which provides a webId.
% We will delve into identity later when we talk about coexisting protocols
% Our implementation of the remote protocol builds upon
% our implementation of the local protocol.

% As we saw in \cref{identity-provider}, the Solid OIDC specification
% allows a user to store some amount of data at their webId.
% That data is a URL which points to a Graffiti object owned by the user
% on some pod, and includes global settings.
% These settings include a list of

% The settings also include forwarding rules which allow a user to

% The verification of these settings is done by the client core library.

% The issue of the federated implementation is delegation.
% Which pods does a user say they want to do?
% It becomes necessary for the Actor to link to a "settings" document
% containing delegation and forwarding rules.
% This means there are no signatures which would violate the deniability property.

% \paragraph{Implementation}

% Our implementation of the remote protocol server\footnote{
%     \url{https://github.com/graffiti-garden/implementation-remote}
% } wraps our local implementation behind
% a web server built on node.js with NestJS and Fastify.
% We point the local implementation's PouchDB instance
% to use a CouchDB database for efficiency and robustness.
% We also use a library from the Community Solid Server project
% for Solid OIDC authentication~\cite{communitysolidserver}.
% The server is bundled as a Docker image for easy
% cross-platform deployment.

% The client-side library makes sure to validate
% incoming data and to verify delegation in case a server attempts
% to lie or otherwise misbehave.

\subsubsection{Commodity Storage Protocol}
\label{above-and-below:commodity-storage-protocol}

An alternative Graffiti protocol builds on top of existing
\emph{commodity storage} providers,
similar to Dropbox.
% Additionally, storage providers have already established
% a viable economic model with a freemium tier and paid service
% for more storage or bandwidth.
% A user does not need to worry about an experimental new service going down.
% However they post performance issues:
% At a high level, the protocol works as follows.
Like the remote protocol, users get to choose which storage
service they would like to store their objects on, including
from one they host themselves.
The client-side implementation of the API---for brevity, ``the client''---%
manages channel-specific files on the storage provider,
each containing all the objects the actor has published to that channel.
The client shares links to those channel files with a \emph{tracker}.
The tracker is similar to a BitTorrent tracker~\cite{bittorrent} but
rather than mapping torrent IDs to IP addresses
it maps channel strings to channel file URLs.
To run \texttt{discover}, the client queries the tracker
about each channel of interest and then fetches each of the resulting URLs for objects.

% More specifically, to \texttt{put} a new object, a client
% performs the following:

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item
% If this is the first time the storage service is being used
% for Graffiti,
% create a directory called \texttt{graffiti} and
% within it directories called \texttt{objects} and
% \texttt{channels}.
% \item
% Create a file containing the object's
% \texttt{value} and \texttt{actor} and store it in the
% \texttt{objects} directory with access control
% set so that only actors in the object's \texttt{allowed} list
% can access it.
% \item
% Create a sharable link to this object
% to use as its \texttt{url}.
% \item
% For each of the object's channels, create a file for it
% within the \texttt{channels} directory, if it does not
% already exist, like \texttt{channels/my-channel}.
% Then add the object's \texttt{url} to the end of the file.
% \item
% Create a sharable link to each channel-specific file
% and publish it to the tracker, if not already done.
% \end{enumerate}

% There is some additional bookkeeping that must be done to
% keep objects in multiple channels in sync, and to enforce an object's
% \texttt{allowed} list using the storage provider's built-in access control,
% but we've omitted those details for brevity.
% The procedure of \texttt{discover}ing an object happens essentially in
% reverse.
% Some additional bookkeeping and privacy details have been ommitted for brevity.
% Additionally, like the remote protocol, the commodity storage protocol
% relies on delegation for verifying that an object was created by a particular actor.

The commodity storage protocol is less efficient than the remote protocol because each
\texttt{discover} call requires a network request per-channel-per-actor,
where as the remote protocol requires only one request per remote server.
If, like email or Mastodon, many actors, especially those in regular contact
use the same server~\cite{mastodonchallenges},
then \texttt{discover} on the remote protocol can take as
few as \emph{one} request while requests made by
the commodity storage protocol scale with the number of actors.
Additionally, the schema provided to \texttt{discover} cannot be used for any
server-side filtering---a client must download \emph{all} objects in a channel
and discard ones that do not match the schema.

Still, for users who tend to participate in small networks, these issues
of scale are not a concern and the use of ``simple'' storage servers can be appealing.
The user does not need to worry that an experimental new service
will go offline or lose their data, and we, as implementers do not need to
worry about developing the infrastructure.
% While the protocol is less efficient than the remote
% protocol, its bootstrapping off of existing
% storage solutions makes it more familiar and robust.

At the time of writing, we have built the tracker server and client\footnote{
  See supplementary materials.
  % \url{https://github.com/graffiti-garden/link-service},
  % \url{https://github.com/graffiti-garden/link-service-client}.

}, and the reference \emph{implementation} of the protocol as a whole,
using Solid ``pods'' as the storage providers,
will soon be complete.

% and the Solid protocol.
% For our purposes, Solid is essentially a federated form of Dropbox.
% % where people can stand up their own Dropbox instance.
% It also shares the same identity system as our remote protocol,
% which we discuss in Section~\ref{above-and-below:coexisting-protocols}.
% Objects stored on the protocol have URLs that start with \texttt{graffiti:solid:}.

\subsubsection{Local Protocol}

% One final ``protocol'' demonstrates additional power of the protocol-agnostic
% API by creating a ``utility'' protocol.
This protocol runs locally
and handles objects with the URL scheme \texttt{graffiti:local:}.
Any data created on the local protocol is only visible on the device on which
it was created.
While such a restriction may seem like a non-starter for an implemetation
of our \emph{social} API, it is invaluable for development.
It provides a similar functionality to running a \texttt{localhost} development server,
however it runs within the implementation of the API itself and so
does not require the complexity of standing up a local server.
Developers can easily create test actors and test objects on the local protocol
without polluting their own online presence or existing Graffiti applications.
% Our implementation of this protocol also includes its own internal
% identity provider allowing for the creation of various test actors.
Finally, the protocol is accessible in deployed applications
and lets regular users try a Graffiti application out without
having to create or log in to an account, as shown in
Figure~\ref{above-and-below:figure:login}.

% We implemented the local protocol\footnote{
% } using PouchDB, a Javascript library that allows for persistent
% storage in both the browser and in node.js.
Because of its relative simplicity, our implementation of the local protocol\footnote{
    See supplementary materials.
    % \url{https://github.com/graffiti-garden/implementation-local}
} also serves
as a reference implementation of the Graffiti API and pieces of its code are also used
throughout other implementations.



% Solid OIDC has some shortcomings
% In the future we would like to support a more extensible identity system
% Solid OIDC is useful for us because it allows a user to log in once.
% However it makes some strong assumptions about identity on the web and
% has left over baggage from the Solid's semantic web vision that can be confusing to users.
% A more recent and extensible Decentralized Identifier is more extensible
% --- identity can be stored by various ``methods'' like \textttt{did:eth:}
% for storing an identity on ethereum.


% such a universal identity standard does not yet exist
% and developing one is outside the scope of this paper.

% The Decentralized Identifier (DID) specification~\cite{dids}
% is an attempt to unify various identity systems, decentralized and centralized.
% % is \emph{almost} sufficient.
% A DID is a URL and, like web URL or a Graffiti object URL,
% the scheme at the beginning of the URL indicates how it should be
% \emph{resolved}.
% For example, a DID with the scheme \texttt{did:web:}
% can be resolved by fetching a web document, where as
% a DID with the scheme \texttt{did:eth:} can be resolved by querying
% the Ethereum blockchain.
% A DID resolves to a \emph{document} that specifies \emph{methods}
% to authenticate the DID.

% Unfortunately, DID authentication methods prove the user's identity
% to only \emph{one} service.
% In the case of Graffiti, this means that a user would have to log in
% once for each underlying server they want to receive private data from,
% which is repetitive for the user and exposes them
% to the complexity of the underlying infrastructure.
% Instead, we would like the the user to be able to only log in \emph{once} to establish a \texttt{session}
% which can then be reused for all interactions.

% Therefore, we are using an earlier identity solution called Solid OIDC.
% Solid OIDC is less extensible, carries over some unneeded baggage from the Solid project,
% and has some usability issues.\footnote{
%     URLs are unnecessarily long.
%     The Solid OIDC specification also provides
%     each user with a webId, a globally unique and human-readable URL
%     that can be shared like a username or an email address.
%     At this URL, the user can store a small amount of public data
%     which we use to implement "delegation".

%     Additionally, existing OIDC servers generate their own
%     webIds, which are often verbose,
%     \emph{e.g.} \url{janedoe.solidcommunity.net/profile/card#me}.
%     There is no reason why a user could not come with their own, simple, domain name, for example
%     \url{id.janedoe.com}, similar to the AT Protocol~\cite{bluesky}. This would also give the users the ability
%     to switch identity providers while maintaining their identity.
%     It is not also currently easy to generate throwaway webIds
%     which could be useful for one-time or anonymous interactions.
% }
% However, a user only logs in \emph{once} to an ``identity provider'' which then
% silently authenticates the user with various services.
% It can also be decentralized, allowing the user to change providers.

% We have implemented this specifically on top of Solid.
% Object URLs start with \texttt{graffiti:solid:}
% This is because it has portable identity,
% where as Dropbox requires each application to register an API key
% and locks in to a partciular mode.
% - Dropbox does not provide a portable identity and becomes a centralized point of control.
% It is also not possible for access control to happen between platforms like Dropbox and Google Drive.
% This is not a problem for Solid, but Solid is unfamiliar and not as robust.
% - With Dropbox application developers need to register an application key.
% We use Solid as our storage provider because it provides
% a more open API and a portable identity system.
% We discuss identity in more detail in section X.

% Using a commercial storage provider like Dropbox allows for access control but only if users
% have a Dropbox account, which locks users into a proprietary service.
% Solid does not have this problem. In fact, it is not possible to use the Dropbox API
% without being used into a Dropbox account, but it is possible to use the Solid API
% without being locked into a Solid account.

\subsubsection{Future Work}
\label{above-and-below:below:future-work}

The remote protocol offloads work to complex storage servers,
while the commodity storage protocol shifts work to clients, keeping the servers simple.
A middle ground could be created where slightly more information is given to
the \emph{tracker}, like when a channel was last modified
or some schema-based indexing of channel content,
to allow for more efficient \texttt{discover} calls.

In the commodify storage protocol, the tracker also serves as a central point of control and so, like in BitTorrent,
it could be replaced with a distributed hash table~\cite{bittorrentdht}. In small networks,
a tracker may not be necessary at all and can be replaced with a gossip protocol.

Currently each server owner can see all the objects and channels
that pass through it. While federation allows users to switch
to servers they trust, those servers are still vulnerable to
subpoenas, putting groups like activists at risk.
It would be valuable to build end-to-end encrypted versions of the remote servers,
tracker, and commodity storage servers, perhaps building on
searchable encryption~\cite{searchableencryption}.

\hl{%
One vulnerability of any system with portable login,
including systems like Solid and the AT Protocol~{\cite{bluesky}},
is the potential of logging into
a malicious application that could steal your data or
post on your behalf without consent.
This risk may make users hesitant to try new applications,
restricting the ecosystem.
Future work should introduce login scopes, such as
ability to grant an application permission only to read objects
that match a particular schema and reside in a particular set of channels.
Since the commodidy storage protocol bootstraps off of
existing storage services that lack such scoping,
it may be necessary to implement scoping client-side
via an iframe to a trusted intermediary domain.

% Finally, non-federated architectures like a peer-to-peer
% implementaiton may also be possible.
% To our knowledge it is not directly possible to implemenet
% Graffiti on top of ecosystems like the AtProtocol or ActivityPub
% without leaking channels. However encrypting data may
% work.

% The remote implementation maps
% tracker: channel->objects
% It requires all servers in the system to be relatively complex.
% The tracker implementation maps
