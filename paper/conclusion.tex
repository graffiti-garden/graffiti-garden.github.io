\section{Conclusion}

Graffiti demonstrates
that it is possible to build a wide variety
of social applications on top of a set of primitives,
and more over that the.

A major limitation of the API as it currently stands
is its support for large media and streaming.
Currently, in applications like The Gloof, images
are stored externally and linked in. In other applications
we did not write about images are encoded with Base64.
It is worth exploring if the principles we apply here

Additionally, there are many social questions about
the usage of this system that we are writing about concurrently:
What norms do we expect in this space?
What does a world look like without hierarchical moderation?
What new harms arise?
How will this effect filter bubbles and polarization?
What about moderating content like CSAM?
Antipaternal
We are confident, but that is left till next time.
