\section{Conclusion}

Graffiti demonstrates
that it is possible to build a wide variety
of social applications on top of a set of primitives,

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    Recommendation engines and Taylor Swift
    \item
    Large media / streaming: 
A major limitation of the API as it currently stands
is its support for large media and streaming.
Currently, in applications like The Gloof, images
are stored externally and linked in. In other applications
we did not write about images are encoded with Base64.
\item 
Social questions: norms? harms? a world without hierarchical moderation / paternalism? filter bubbles? polarization? CSAM?
\end{enumerate}
