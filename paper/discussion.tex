\subsubsection{Illegal Content}

If moderation is reified and not actually deleting content,
what can be done about universally repugant content such as CSAM?
Here we come up against issues of \emph{trust} which we
have seperated into the \emph{protocol} layer rather than
the API layer.
End-to-end encrypted systems, like Signal, make it impossible
for users to be surveilled but also impossible to detect illegal content.
In centralized unencrypted systems it may be possible to do both, but
users must trust the system to act in their best interest.
% In certain decentralized systems, like BitTorrent, IPFS, and Blockchain
% it is possible to detect illegal content but impossible to delete it.

At the moment this appears to be a trolley problem:
if users can have complete trust in the system to act in their
best interest the system will also be acting in the best interest
of bad actors.
perhaps technological advancements will make it possible to create
a system that users can trust to act in their best interest,
while also keep out users doing truly harmful things.
We demonstrate that multiple protocols can implement the
Graffiti API and leave it up to users to decide which they want
and leave it up to other researchers with more knowledge of
and for future work to find better soltions.

% This works for moderation of legal content but there is the question of
% what about content that doesn't want to exist anywhere, such as CSAM.
% Mechanisms to delete content are dependent on the underlying implementation of the
% system. In some systems, such as end-to-end encrypted systems like Signal,
% and WhatsApp, it is impossible detect such content. In distributed systems
% like BitTorrent, IPFS, or Blockchain technologies it is impossible to delete content.

Interaction relativy also allows applications to introduce new sorts of interactions
without having to coordinate with all the other existing applications,
keeping the ecosystem flexible and interoperable.
For example, an application could [add a "Trust" button to posts](https://social.cs.washington.edu/pub_details.html?id=trustnet)
and use it assess the truthfulness of posts made on applications across Graffiti.
New sorts of interactions like these can be smoothly absorbed by the broader ecosystem
as a [folksonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy).

\subsubsection{Disabled Replies}

Disabling replies a feature of Youtube and Instagram and although not
implemented, one of the most requested features on Mastodon\footnote{
    Mastodon's ``Disabl replies'' feature request has been actively discussed
    for six years
    \url{https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/8565}
}.
According to our system the replies would not really be disabled
they would just be hidden in application that are built to understand
the disabledReplies property.
Is it possible the \emph{existence} of such replies even if they could
not be seen is harmful?

Unfortunately, if someone is trying to harass

What if though, the person who disabled replies was spreading misinformation?
Wouldn't it be nice for other users to be able to

Users could use disabled replies as a `mic drop'.

Alternatiely,
people from the particular crowd start
@-mentioning Person A in their toots, attacking them,
but disabling replies on these toots, making it harder
for the person to respond.

It also means a person cannot be shamed for something they really
want to do.

What about misinformation? There should be both ways for authors to
mark that they want replies disabled or to mark ``approve'' certain comments
and a way for communities to
mark comments as particularly
